Portfolio Reflection – Systems Analysis & Design

the driverpass project was for a client named DriverPass, who wanted a system to help students schedule lessons, take practice tests, and track their progress. staff also needed tools to manage notes, schedules, and accounts.

i think i did well at taking the client’s needs and turning them into clear documents with both functional and nonfunctional requirements. if i could change one thing, i’d add more detail in the nonfunctional requirements—like specific performance goals—so the system would have clearer standards.

to build the design, i paid attention to what the client really wanted and made sure the features matched their concerns, like adding progress tracking so students could see improvement. meeting user needs is key—if the system doesn’t solve their problems, it doesn’t matter how “good” it looks on paper.

my approach is to break things into steps: gather requirements, model the system with diagrams, and document clearly. in the future i’d like to use more check-ins with clients and keep using diagrams to make designs easier to understand.
